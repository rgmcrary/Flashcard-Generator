Flashcard Generator

This application has 2 functions. 

The first is a basic flash card simulator. The simulator displays a complete question, has a 2 second pause and then displays the answer in the console.

The second is a cloze flash card simulator. This simulator uses a full sentence, removes a specified portion and replaces it with 3 elipses. It then displayes the partial sentence in the console followed by a 2 second pause and then displays the missing portion.

If the type of card is not specified in the console request, the user is prompted to enter either BasicCard or ClozeCard to continue with the application.

This application uses Node.js, and a JavaScript timeout function.
